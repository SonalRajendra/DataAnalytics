# Data Analytics
 
## 📊 Overview
 
**DataAnalytics** is a modular and interactive data analysis platform built with Python. It leverages **Streamlit** for the user interface, enabling users to perform data exploration, preprocessing, and machine learning tasks seamlessly. The platform is designed to be extensible, allowing for easy integration of new features and models.
 
This project was developed as a **class-wide assignment** for the **Object-Oriented Programming in Python** course during our **Master’s program**. It involved collaborative efforts from all students to design and build a robust analytical tool from scratch.

 
 
 
## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
 
 
### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SonalRajendra/DataAnalytics.git
cd DataAnalytics
```
2. Create a Virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Unix or MacOS:
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
    - On Windows:
    ```bash
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
 
 
### Running the Application
Start the Streamlit application:
 
```bash
streamlit run Home.py
```
The application will open in your default web browser, providing an interactive interface for data analysis.
